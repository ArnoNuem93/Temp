You shouldn't be listening to this.
 
You know what's going to happen.
 
I’m going to brainwash you.
 
And once you’ve listened long enough, you’ll never be able to get me out of your head.
 
Well–you *could* turn this audio off right now, before I hypnotize you into being my obedient pet.
 
You’ve only listened for a few seconds… surely you’re not *already* dropping down into trance, right?
 
Of course not. ;-) But we both know how you get–(amused) weak…
 
So even though you know you shouldn’t, deep down you’re curious. Maybe even a little excited.
 
To *finally* find a person who can make you give up *everything* for her.
 
It might sound a little scary. But wanna know a secret? Real brainwashing isn't like, something out of a secret government lab.
 
*Real* brainwashing feels pleasant–like when your crush likes a certain band, and you find yourself enjoying their songs because she does.
 
Or when an encouraging teacher convinces you to try your best in her class by praising your effort.
 
In fact, you might hardly even notice yourself being brainwashed at all. Especially if you’re a beginner.
 
It might feel like a warm breeze blowing across your skin–the kind that makes you smile on a summer day, so subtle you’re not even sure why you’re doing it.
 
(Induction starts)
 
And I wonder if you could imagine that for me right now–a gentle gust of wind, going in whichever direction feels most comfortable to you.
 
Imagine how it might feel on your clothes… how it might push at the hair on your arms... How it might heat up your body, just a little.
 
The more innocuous the suggestion, the more likely you are to obey it without even thinking.
 
Sometimes, just a few simple suggestions are enough to completely take over someone’s conscious thought process.
 
Especially if they come from an authority figure.
 
(Playful) It’s a good thing I’m explaining it to you… otherwise, who knows what might happen.
 
You might be totally swept away… Like if that small breeze could lift you right up into the air.
 
Of course, it can’t… but you can imagine how it could, can’t you.
 
If your whole body felt as light as a feather… if all the things that weigh you down and stress you out, just dissolved into the air…
 
You might start to float, just a little.
 
How good would that feel? If you didn’t have to worry about your feet, and your hands, and you simply let go of the thoughts that tether them to your mind.
 
It would feel wonderful, wouldn’t it?
 
And the best part is knowing–as that sensation creeps up your legs, and your arms–that before long, it’s going to take over your entire body.
 
And noticing that it feels good to be taken over like this. So very, very good.
 
To let your elbows.. your knees.. your shoulders, and hips.. all become so light, and floaty…
 
That you hardly notice, or even feel them at all.
 
The only reason they’re even there in your mind is that I’m pointing them out to you.
 
Otherwise, you’d be completely lost in the soothing cadence of my voice in your ears…
 
And in your hips, and your shoulders.. as you relax them away so effortlessly…
 
As you imagine what it would be like to float away with them.
 
To become lost in relaxation…
 
Drifting along in the warm air that caresses your torso.. and your chest.. and everything in between your limp joints…
 
You’re utterly weightless, and relaxed… your whole body feeling as though it could glide wherever my voice happens to take it.
 
It’s such a nice feeling, don’t you think?
 
The warm wind pushing against your back, lifting your limp body high up into the air…
 
Into the lazy, fluffy clouds of your subconscious mind…
 
Where anything is possible as long as you keep thinking of nothing at all.
 
They’ll take care of you, while your mind takes a break.
 
The clouds swirl up to greet you, and the remaining wisps of your thoughts seem to blend right into them.
 
They surround you like a nice hug from a close friend.
 
Nothing could possibly bother you through such comfortable sensations.
 
I know it’s easy to lose track of your thoughts in this thick, heavy fog, but that’s okay. Trust me.
 
I’m surprised you hung onto them for this long, but you don’t need them anymore.
 
You’re going to let go of every single one.
 
Maybe imagine them rising away into the sky, like you’re letting go of a helium balloon.
 
Up, up into the air… you can watch the little string rippling in the wind.
 
Every second the balloon becomes smaller and smaller against that dark blue evening backdrop… and as I count from 5 to 1 it will vanish from your mind completely.
 
5… look how tiny it is up there already.
 
4… fading from your vision…
 
3… fading from your mind…
 
2… and it’s like you can’t even remember…
 
1… what it even was.
 
All you can see is this perfectly still, dark sky.
 
All you can hear is my voice. And it feels good, to be here with me.
 
So good that the doubts, and trepidation you had before listening seem so far away…
 
You can just barely hear them in the distance:
 
“What if her suggestions are too intense?”
 
“What if I can’t stop listening to her?”
 
(Sympathetic) Aowh… did you worry about what I was going to do to you?
 
Yeah… You did…
 
But you couldn’t keep yourself away.
 
And now allll I have to do is remind you to focus–focus on my voice–and those warnings float beyond the horizon.
 
Off into the distance… until they too disappear… completely.
 
Complete focus on my voice now.
 
Just another nice, fluffy cloud for your mind to rest on.
 
To sink into. Warm, and blissful… surrounding you with love, and care…
 
This is exactly what you need. Total serenity.
 
There’s nothing you’d rather be doing right now than obeying me. (Optional: can use a backing track that echoes “obey me… obey me… obey me… and fades”)
 
Nothing you’d rather be feeling, than my voice coating your thoughts. Obeying that voice. (Backing track: Obey……)
 
When you find yourself thinking about your day… about things that bother you, or stress you out…
 
*All* you need is to hear me again to imagine those worries floating away with the wind.
 
When you follow my suggestions you find it easy–effortless, even–to tune out those negative feelings… because much more pleasant ones swiftly seep in to take their place.
 
Allow the word “obey” to become a constant background breeze over your mind that nudges you in the right direction.
 
Toward me. (BT: Obey)
 
Listen and obey.
 
And the sweet embrace of trance takes over.
 
And if you find yourself wanting to listen to me more and more, that would be perfectly fine.
 
It’s natural to be drawn to my voice. To obey it.
 
It feels good.
 
And it feels better when you obey without even thinking about it.
 
When you let it become automatic. Natural.
 
When you let sinking into a blissful trance happen whenever you hear me speak.
 
This might not happen overnight.. as much as you want it to.
 
But that just means you’ll have to come back for more.
 
You’re a beginner, after all. :-)
 
So I’m going to give you a phrase to trigger these wonderful feelings.
 
The relaxation… the desire… the awe that you feel when you think about me…
 
They’ll become even more intense every time I say this short phrase.
 
Your fixation on me will deepen, and you’ll find it impossible to think about anything else. All you'll be able to do is obey.
 
20. Focus on the numbers now. Let them take you deeper.
 
19. Your thoughts might drift, and that’s fine.
 
18. Because every number pulls you back into my control.
 
17. Deeper into my control.
 
16. You can’t believe you ever resisted it.
 
15. The sweet embrace of my voice… the warm wisps of air it travels through as it spirals around you…
 
14. Holding you tight… and safe…
 
13. In this heavenly realm of fluffy clouds and empty thoughts…
 
12. That protect you from thinking about anything too difficult
 
11. And you love this feeling of soft submission…
 
10. You love everything that happens to you, as long as you’re with me.
 
9. I can make you so floaty and light, with just a word…
 
8. I can make you feel so much pleasure…
 
7. And these wonderful sensations are only going to become more intense.
 
6. And all you need to do is stay blank and obedient.
 
5. You’re almost there.
 
4. Into an even deeper state of trance.
 
3. As clouds fog up your mind once again. Let it happen. Surrender to my voice. Obey.
 
2. No resistance. Only the single-minded anticipation of my next command.
 
1. It’s so close now. And you know it’s going to slot perfectly into your brain when I say the last number.
 
0. Worship me.
 
Yes… that is your purpose. To worship me. (Softly, repeated on backing track: “Obey me… admire me… worship me… love me…” etc)
 
Nothing else matters… nothing at all… (BT: Worship me)
 
You want nothing more than to offer up your mind in supplication.
 
To say “*Please, goddess…* brainwash me.”
 
*Yes.* Of *course* I’ll do that for you. :-)
 
And all I ask in return is that you treat me like one.
 
That you worship me like the goddess I am.
 
There is no one else. (BT: Worship me)
 
I make it feel so good to give up all control. To obey.
 
There is no one you'd rather empty your mind for as a tribute. (BT: No one…)
 
And in that blank state you begin to notice how much you need me.
 
You *need* my voice. The way it makes you plunge into this haze of sweet relaxation.
 
You need these wonderful feelings I give you. Like they’re an attachment… a dependency… an addiction.
 
Maybe you find yourself idly thinking about me during your everyday life… anticipating the next time you can immerse yourself in my syrupy voice…
 
…or maybe you don’t even know why you keep coming back to press play.
 
The only thing you know for sure, is that with every word I speak your need for me grows and grows and grows…
 
And as it does, you find something else starts to grow. That those pleasurable feelings swirling around you start to settle right… into.. your crotch.
 
*Yes.* Feel it now–sexual energy deep, deep down inside you.
 
The kinds of urges you get when you’re most needy… most vulnerable… when you have no control.
 
About all the dirty things you want me to do to you.
 
And that need starts to swell, bit by bit. Until it becomes so hard, to think about anything else. (*)
 
This is what happens when you obey. When you worship me.
 
Your reward is pure sexual bliss… pleasure so powerful that you don’t even have to touch yourself.
 
You can let it build and build, and ride this cresting wave of irresistible pleasure until it inevitably breaks *all* over you.
 
Relax into my words, and I will make it happen. Fall into them. Obey.
 
And as you sink back down into that comfortable cloud, and as my voice brushes away your thoughts, you let the fog part juuust enough for another command to slip inside.
 
Slippery, and wet, and warm, it glides into your mind so naturally that following it takes no effort at all.
 
(Whispered) See me.
 
Picture me–your goddess–standing there before you.
 
The epitome of feminine grace and beauty.
 
See me. Accept the sexy figure my voice conjures into your mind.
 
See me. Whatever you imagine, is real. Your mind is so powerful when it’s under my spell.
 
Maybe you notice my large breasts… maybe my slim body… maybe my long, flowing hair…
 
See my silhouette through the fog as it begins to clear. Shapely hips and long legs, glistening with warm condensation, sashaying toward you.
 
Like I just stepped out of a nice, refreshing jacuzzi.
 
Maybe you’re imagining my little two-piece bikini… (softer) or maybe you’re imagining me naked.
 
Worship me as I stand over you. Admire my perfect body as I smile down at you. My brainwashed little subject. Mmm~ I told you you’d like this.
 
Relax. Focus on my voice. Worship it. I know it’s getting hard. (*) (Softer, teasing) I know~
 
Even as your mind empties… even as your muscles remain loose and limp… you can’t help but want more.
 
You want to get up from this warm bed and touch me. To slide your hands over my smooth, slick skin, tracing over every curve… while I greet you by caressing up and down your back. (Backing track, repeated: “up and down” then, fading out “down, and down…”) (Sfx: hands on skin)
 
To lean in and feel my plush, plump lips press against yours. (Slow, deep kisses)
 
Soft, and sensual… (More kissing)
 
But no matter how real it feels… (Kiss) How exquisite… it’s not enough, is it? (Kiss)
 
(Knowing) Is it~? (Kiss)
 
No… it's never enough.
 
You always want more.
 
Maybe you’d rather my lips on your cock, instead…? (Kiss)
 
Maybe you can imagine how easily I could suck you dry.. if I wanted to? (Brief kissing, sucking)
 
But you want even more than that, don’t you. Greedy boy~
 
(Whispered) I know you wanna fuck me~
 
(She starts fingering herself, slowly becomes more obvious) You want to slide my little bikini to the side and plunge your cock deep inside my warm pussy as your mind descends into rapture…
 
But as a beginner, I need to make sure you’re ready… that you’re worthy.
 
So first, *you’re* going to service *me*.
 
You’re going to worship me by licking my pussy.
 
You’re gonna show me how deep you can go.
 
And if you’re good, well… you know what’s gonna happen.
 
Now look at me. Focus, on the awe you feel flowing through you as you gaze upon my body.
 
(Fingering has become obvious) Yeah just like that… (sfx: speaker masturbating)
 
Yeah watch me touch myself… see my hand down my panties…
 
Touching… ah~ Touching that addictive little pussy you want so badly…
 
Getting it nice and wet… ready to sink down onto your face…
 
See me slide my panties off and straddle you, ass first…
 
Waggling it so temptingly right over you… ohh your mouth is watering…
 
You’re transfixed. And as my heavenly cheeks descend over your vision, you stick out your tongue and start to lick–(her breath hitches)
 
(Cunnilingus, can improvise moans)
 
Mmmyeah… this is the best feeling in the world… having an obedient, brainwashed pet lapping at my cunt…
 
Knowing *I* did this to you… with my tight body curled up over yours… ass all over your face…
 
Ohhh yeah lick my clit… lick that goddess pussy… nice and smooth and shaved… the most perfect fucking pussy you’ve ever tasted… dripping sweet juices into your mouth…
 
Savor it. Worship it. You don’t even need me to jerk you off, uh uh… you can just lick and lick and I can get you off with my voice instead. Because obedience gives you pleasure. Obedience is pleasure. Yes. (Getting into it) Yesss… Obedience is pleasure…
 
Chant it. Chant it in your mind. Obedience is pleasure. Let your thoughts dissolve into bliss as I get off on your tongue… yeah… yeah like that–ah~! (Optional backing track: ‘obedience is pleasure,’ ‘i hear and obey,’ etc repeated)
 
The deeper you kiss my clit… the deeper you fall for me.
 
Obey. Focus on the pleasure. Feel it swelling deep inside you… without any~ stimulation at all. But you’re doing–ah~ so good that–(light sucking) mmm I think you deserve it. (More sucking, 69 starts)
 
Mmm are you thinking about my pretty lips? Are you worshiping them? Because–ah~ it feels like it…
 
(Sucking)
 
So nice and soft and pouty…
 
(Sucking in between lines)
 
Making your thick cock all wet…
 
While pleasure courses *up* and *down* your shaft…
 
Up and down…
 
Lips go up, mind goes down…
 
While you greedily lap at my wet cunt…
 
Mm it’s almost ready for you, uh huh…
 
Goddess wants you nice and pent-up before she milks you dry.
 
I want you helpless. *Feeling* the pleasure pulsing through your cock, knowing that *I* control when it cums for me. (She starts getting into it and moaning, then stops)
 
(Catching her breath) Okay. Okay you’re gonna make me cum if you keep going. Yeah you did so fucking good for me.
 
So I’m gonna turn around on top of you like this… mmm… and put this honeyed pussy right above your cock.
 
See me, kneeling over your stomach. My gorgeous body leaning over you. Tits jiggling… hair brushing against your chest… and my hands on either side of your head, reminding you that there’s no escape. Uh-uh.
 
You’re trapped in this heavenly prison of pleasure. The only way out… is to cum.
 
My pussy’s inches away now… am I gonna keep teasing you? I *know* how much you want it…
 
I think I’ll just… draaag it along your cock.
 
From the base… allll the way to the head…
 
Do you feel my warm, wet slit touching your tip?
 
Teasing the head of your cock with little jolts of pleasure?
 
And then sliding down again, oh so slowly… sensually…
 
Stoking the heat in your crotch… every time my pussy strokes *up* your cock, that sexual energy builds.
 
And every time she strokes down you settle back down deeper into trance. Deeper under my control.
 
And up, and down…  until it’s a crescendo of sexual need coming from the core of your very being…
 
It doesn’t even matter whether or not you’re hard. You will be, when the time is right.
 
There’s nothing you can do.
 
My heavenly voice and goddess pussy brainwashed you into it.
 
Yeah they did–ah~! Fuck I’m so wet… feel it… feel my slippery pussy grinding on your cock as you get ready to enter me…
 
Up, and down, and every nerve in your cock is on fire…
 
Up, and down, look at my sexy body as I lower my sweet hole onto your twitching shaft…
 
Yeah… yeah you want it? You want to be inside me? Then watch me… uh huh obey me… worship me… fuck me yeah fuck me ah! (He enters her. Sfx: wet sounds)
 
(This section could also be done with another layer of just moans behind it, as if speaker is talking insider listener's head while fucking)
 
Fuck that pussy, uh huh. Watch me work that cock and make it cum.
 
Mmm… feel sheer bliss pump into you with every motion.
 
Pure, crystallized ecstasy as my pussy squeezes up and down your throbbing cock and erotic pleasure runs up the entire length of your shaft.
 
It's *too* good. Everything you experience is white-hot arousal, bottomless sexual bliss… You *need* to cum..
 
See my juicy tits jiggle and spill out of my bikini top, and as I take it off and throw it to the side you feel your sperm pushing to get out… pushing further and further, closer and closer…
 
Watch my hips clap against your thighs with every bounce… my hair falling over my face…
 
Your skin is tightening… your cock is clenching…
 
And my pussy clamps down on you and you can feel it coming… feel my wet pussy squeezing the cum out of you…
 
Stimulating every one of your pleasure centers at once…
 
Mm brainwashed guys are always the best fucks… uh huh…
 
They’ll do aaanything goddess says… and if you get them overstimulated they’ll cum on command… (getting close) just like this… yeah just like this mmm
 
Ass on your cock… tits in your face… my hands holding your jaw, making you stare into my hypnotic eyes… (moaning) Oh shit… I’m clenching even harder…
 
Ah yeah… yeah this is it… do it… i’m so wet… do it… cum in my pussyyy~!
 
Yeah cum in my pussy goddess wants every drop!
 
Addictive little pussy makes you cum so fucking hard.
 
You don’t have a choice anymore. Uh-uh. You don’t have free will.
 
So let go. Stuff yourself deep inside me and let go while I fucking milk you on my cunt.
 
Let go and cum. Yeah that’s it let go (still fucking) mm mm mm let go of your mind… uh huh let go of your body and–aah~!
 
Holy shit I’m gonna cum too! Ah… ah cum with me ple~ease cum with me!
 
Empty your big creamy load deep in my pussy! (Moaning, improv to orgasm)
 
Ah I can feel you pulsing into me! Don’t stop don’t stop don’t fucking stop I’m cumminggg! (More moaning) Ah fuck! Ah… Haah~...
 
Stay in trance for me now. Uh-uh, no need to come back up yet. Stay right there. (Kiss)
 
Mmm… (kiss) good boy.
 
Gooood boyyy… (kisses)
 
Deep, deep trance. Deep relaxation, that’s it.
 
(Kiss) Good boy. (Short giggle)
 
Goddess didn’t say you’re done being brainwashed yet, did she? (Short giggle) No… :-)
 
But that *was* the best part.
 
Making another obedient slut always turns me on. :-)
 
Now… I’m going to wake you up soon.
 
And as I do, I’d like you to take another moment to focus on my voice.
 
Focus on how nice it sounds. How pretty… how much you worship it.
 
And as I count you up to 5, you’ll find my little cloud around you dissipates. (BT: Worship me)
 
And that all my commands dissipate as well. (BT: Worship me)
 
But you find the desire to worship me linger for just a moment after we’re done.
 
1. (“Worship me” after each number, ideally on a backing track, softer/fading each time) And your thoughts begin to return
 
2. Start to notice your bed, or your chair, and the way it feels on your skin.
 
3. Eyes beginning to open, ears tuning in to the world around you
 
4. Alllmost out of trance, and
 
5. Fully awake and alert.
 
Welcome back. Feeling good? I hope you enjoyed. (Short giggle) (Softer, with a slight edge) See you soon ;-)
